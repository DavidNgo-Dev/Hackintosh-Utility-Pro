# Hackintosh-Utility-Pro
Hackintosh Utility Pro is a simple to use application which allows you to easily setup your Hackintosh USB installer within a few clicks of buttons. The application allows to customize your boot settings by giving you the options of choosing your correct and specified kexts for your audio drivers, graphics drivers, Ethernet and wireless drivers etc. The simple flat design UI makes it easy to install kext by just selecting the computer parts you have, in which the application will interpret and select the appropriate kext designated to the product. This application will NOT install Apple Mac OS X onto the USB, it is just post installer with pre-defined application set to your specification. To install Mac OS X onto a USB go to our website for a guide.

# Note
This is a work in progress application. Which means some features may or may not be working. By using this application, you will take full responsibility for any damages or other miscellaneous issue done to your computer. The application will receive updates to ensure that new released parts and kexts are added to the database. Please allow time for me to update the library as I’m the only developer.\

# WINDOWS AND MAC CLIENT SIDE
The windows utility will only be only installed on a FAT32 USB driver whereas the Mac application side we be ran as a script. The window client was made for people who do not have access to a mac nearby, thus making this application useful as you can install what you need from windows.
